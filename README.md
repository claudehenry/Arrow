# The Arrow programming language
#### _An esoteric programming language._

Developed by Claude-Henry Rochenoir, for the sole purpose of  trolling a friend. This language represents the most impractical and annoying to use programming language that I could envision, whilst still maintaining a level of usability. An important thing to note is that this language is a work in progress and partially a joke, so use it your own risk, I’m responsible for anything, however, all I’ll say is that's a hardware problem not a software one :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
